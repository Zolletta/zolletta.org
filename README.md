# Zolletta's Digital Garden

This is the source code for my personal website, [zolletta.org](https://zolletta.org). It's a digital garden where I learn in public.

## About the Project

This website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator. The theme used is a customized version of [Kawaii](https://github.com/yuis-ice/hugo-kawaii).

The main focus of the content is book summaries on foundational subjects that don't age.
