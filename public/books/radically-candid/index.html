        <p class="kawaii-article-description">A summary of Kim Scott&#39;s framework for giving and receiving feedback, balancing caring personally with challenging directly.</p>
        
    </header>
    
    <div class="kawaii-content">
        <p>In this article I want to talk about <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250235374/radical-candor-fully-revised-updated-edition">“Radical Candor”</a>, whose subtitle is “Be a kick-ass boss without losing your humanity”, by Kim Scott, a book originally published in 2019.</p>
<p>But wait, I am not a boss, so why should I care? Because this approach is relevant even if you, like me, are part of a team.</p>
<p>There are two main pillars in radical candor:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>care personally</strong>: You don’t have to be just professional. That’s the minimum. You should show that you care about your interlocutors as human beings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>challenge directly</strong>: you should give feedback to people, even when it’s negative feedback. And precisely because you care about them as human beings you need to give that feedback, because otherwise how can they move forward? Feedback coming from a person you trust is received with much more credit and less bias and this contributes to nurturing the caring environment we are envisioning. Besides that, the person receiving the feedback will try to adapt to the requested changes (if any) and will be encouraged to give feedback to others, too.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>See? The only prerequisite here is being a human being, not being a boss.</p>
<p>Together, care personally and challenge directly are a way to offer guidance.</p>
<p>Why did the author call this approach Radical Candor?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Radical</strong> because there are many  people used to not saying what they really think.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Candor</strong> because the key is getting people used to direct communication so that there cannot be misunderstandings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s an approach that is very context-dependent: It’s “relationally and culturally aware” (p. 308). What worked in a company, in a country, won’t necessarily work in another.</p>
<p>At the heart of this approach, is, of course, the respect of the other. You don’t hold the good points and the others the bads. You should have an open-minded attitude because you will encounter people with different worldviews and values, and you’ll have to care personally for those people too.</p>
<p>When you are lacking the care when giving feedback, you’re in the <strong>Obnoxious Aggression</strong> quadrant. When this is a reflection of “bosses should act like tyrants and employees like slaves” of course criticism is not a tool for improvement and can lead to toxic environments.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, it’s better to offer rude feedback than to fall in the other two quadrants (be insincere or too emphatic). Remember, however: don’t blame the people (their internal essence), blame their behavior!</p>
<p><strong>Manipulative Insincerity</strong> happens when you give feedback (or not) with your own purposes in mind, to be liked or to spare you some emotional job because you are too tired, maybe.</p>
<p>The focus switches from the other person to your own personal gain.</p>
<p>The other quadrant is <strong>Ruinous Empathy</strong>: when you prioritize “being nice” instead of critique, you fail to give a chance to improvement.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the candor the author refers to concerns the domain of business; “relationships require some privacy, so while I am all for transparency when it comes to business results, I don’t believe that Radical Transparency fosters good working relationships, contributes to psychological safety, or results in a productive, happy culture” (preface, page XII).</p>
<h3 id="how-to-accept-criticism">How to accept criticism</h3>
<p>When accepting criticism, remember: you are there to listen and understand: repeat what they are telling you to clarify what they meant, ask questions, but do not defend yourself (it’s not the correct setting!).</p>
<p>If you agree with the feedback, act accordingly, making a change as soon as possible or at least, if things need more time to be accomplished, make something visible to let your criticizers know you rewarded what they told you.</p>
<p>If you don’t agree with what you heard, commit to another meeting, where you and the others will talk in-depth about your motivations and you’ll give space to others to talk back.</p>
<p>Ignoring feedback is not respectful.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-offer-feedback">How to offer feedback</h3>
<p>You should describe:</p>
<ul>
<li>the situation: try to be precise and concrete</li>
<li>the behaviour</li>
<li>the impact you observed</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s all. Don’t be personal or subjective. This applies to both critiques and praises.</p>
<p>Give feedback as soon as needed, when memories are fresh enough. Remember that, even if you are not personal (i.e. you’re saying that’s wrong and not you’re wrong), the receiver of the critique will feel it as personal, because we spend a lot of time working together. So, remember to care personally and be compassionate!</p>
